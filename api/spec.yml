  title: Navidrome API
  description: >
    This spec describes the Navidrome API, which allows users to browse and manage their music library via a JSON:API 
    based interface. The API provides endpoints for albums, tracks, artists, playlists and images, along with their 
    relationships. Clients can retrieve information about the items in the library, filter and sort results, and 
    perform actions such as creating and deleting playlists. With this API, developers can build music apps and 
    services that integrate with Navidrome music server, providing a seamless experience for users to access and 
    manage their music collection.
